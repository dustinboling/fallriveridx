fallriver IDX - TODO

**NOTE**
* The client does not stay alive for very long, the nonce becomes invalid.
* Thus, spin up a new client as needed. Do not rely on an initializer.
* Or, we can rescue from the nonce error: '20036: V2.7.0 1186: Nonce is invalid'
* Another option: keep the client alive with an hourly(?) task

**QUERIES**
* Use the following syntax to find things in the database.
* We have to do this because of the uppercase letters in postgres columns.
* Note that arel-style queries work normally, and are more performant.
*== Listing.where('"ListingDate" like ?', "1987%")
* OBSERVATIONS
* query time went down by adding a limit, 20 seems to be the max with o indices (20 =~ 600ms in AR)

#6 - devise authentication with token authenticable module support for json queries

#1 - write Property seed task
#2 - write ActiveAgent seed task
