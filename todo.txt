fallriver IDX - TODO

**NOTE**
* The client does not stay alive for very long, the nonce becomes invalid.
* Thus, spin up a new client as needed. Do not rely on an initializer.
* Or, we can rescue from the nonce error: '20036: V2.7.0 1186: Nonce is invalid'

**QUERIES**
* Use the following syntax to find things in the database.
* We have to do this because of the uppercase letters in postgres columns.
* Note that arel-style queries work normally, and are more performant.
*== Listing.where('"ListingDate" like ?', "1987%")
